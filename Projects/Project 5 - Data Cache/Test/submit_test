# P5 submission validation script - tests tar, compile, and sssp.mips output
# Lee B. Hinkle, Texas State University
# Instructions - run this on zeus
#   make a new temp directory $mkdir temp
#   copy the following files into this directory
#     this script file
#     your submission tar file
#     the input file sssp.mips from project 2
#     the output file sssp.out provided in the p5 assignment tarball
#   if you haven't already cd into the temp directory
#   change the 'yourNetID' string below to match your tar filename
#   Note:  a quirk of bash scripts is no spaces can be in assignment statements
#   execute the script
#   if you get a file execution error you may have to $chmod +x submit_test
#   You should see the result of untar, make, execute, and compare
#   Prior to the output you should see your name 3 times (extracted from headers)
#   with final message of: 
#   "Files sssp.out and temp.out are identical"
